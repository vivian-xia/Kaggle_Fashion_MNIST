# Kaggle_Fashion_MNIST

The goal is to classify the images into its corresponding fashion items class. There are ten classes including t-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, and ankle boot. Using different model arcitechtures, models are built to solve this classification problem. 

Experiment 2 with a test accuracy of 0.92 is the recommended model because there are less parameters that need to be trained with a small cost of 0.01 accuracy. A recommendation is to the combine Class 6, shirts, and 0, t-shirt/top to improve overall accuaracy as it is hard for even a human to decipher the two classes.
